# Discord GalleryView (1.0)

Discord Bot and tool for creating a "gallery view" with the media in a specified discord channel.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with [GalleryView](https://discordgalleryview.ezsnova.repl.co/) is to use the discord bot.
You can **invite the bot to your server** [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1136039549894676490&permissions=124928&scope=bot)

Once the bot is in your server, you can use slash commands to either create or get a gallery view.
